### [Call Center Statistics](https://kylejlynch.github.io/UMRF/)
Extracts weekly performance data from .csv files for call center agents, stores it in an SQL database, and computes statistics places on a summary page. This program converts the raw CSV files to Pandas DataFrames. The program then cleans, extracts, and stores the data in an SQLite database—creating a separate table for each agent as well as a summary table containing sums and averages for each agent.

### [PC12 Research](https://kylejlynch.github.io/PC12/)
My master’s research involved approximately a hundred files totaling to thousands of individual measurements of length and orientation of cells in response to electric fields. I wrote a program which iterates through all of the files and extracts the data into Pandas DataFrames. The program then performs some math (vector components) and statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, and t-tests) using NumPy and SciPy. Finally, Matplotlib is used to plot the data with error bars and significance indicators (p-values).
