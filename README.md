### [Call Center Statistics Webapp](https://kylejlynch.github.io/UMRF/)
Receives daily and weekly performance data from emails for call center agents, stores it in two SQL databases, computes statistics, and produces an Excel workbook and several performance plots available for review and download on a website hosted by PythonAnywhere.

### [PC12 Neuronal Biomaterials Research](https://kylejlynch.github.io/PC12/)
My masterâ€™s research involved approximately a hundred files totaling to thousands of individual measurements of length and orientation of cells in response to electric fields. I wrote a program which iterates through all of the files and extracts the data into Pandas DataFrames. The program then performs some math (vector components) and statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, and t-tests) using NumPy and SciPy. Finally, Matplotlib is used to plot the data with error bars and significance indicators (p-values). This work resulted in a peer-reviewed journal article which can be [found here](http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4983/9/2/30/htm).
