### [Fourier Series Forecasting](https://kylejlynch.github.io/Fourier_Forecasting/)
Uses Fourier Series to fit time series data and forecast future trends by analyzing the Fourier coefficients from fit data.

### [Call Center Statistics Web Application and Predictive Analytics](https://kylejlynch.github.io/UMRF/)
Receives daily and weekly performance data from emails for call center agents, stores it in two SQL databases, computes statistics, and produces an Excel workbook and several performance plots available for review and download on a website hosted by PythonAnywhere. I also use several machine learning algorithms as well as SciPy curve_fit for predicitve analytics/schedule optimization.

### [PC12 Neuronal Biomaterials Research](https://kylejlynch.github.io/PC12/)
My masterâ€™s research involved approximately a hundred files totaling to thousands of individual measurements of length and orientation of cells in response to electric fields. I wrote a program which iterates through all of the files and extracts the data into Pandas DataFrames. The program then performs some math (vector components) and statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, and t-tests) using NumPy and SciPy. Finally, Matplotlib is used to plot the data with error bars and significance indicators (p-values). This work resulted in a peer-reviewed journal article which can be [found here](http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4983/9/2/30/htm).

### [Data Science Assignments](https://kylejlynch.github.io/Assignments/)
Select homework assignments which I felt displayed a variety of skills important in the field of data science (Data science libraries, Machine Learning, large datasets).

### [Physics Computation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kylejlynch/Physics/blob/master/Motion%20of%20a%20Pendulum.ipynb)  
Introducing myself to computational physics/mathematics. I start here with a simple calculation of the motion of a damped pendulum with a large initial angle, which is described by a non-linear differential equation. This is then compared to the linear, undamped motion which can be solved easily by separation of variables (without computational methods).
